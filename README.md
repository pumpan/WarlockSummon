+ Intelligent summoning logic: Prioritizes eligible group members based on factors such as distance, instance type, and summoning cooldowns.
+ Real-time updates: Provides dynamic feedback on the number of eligible players for summoning, updating the button text accordingly.
+ Graphical user interface (GUI) integration: Displays a movable button on the screen for easy access and visibility during gameplay.
